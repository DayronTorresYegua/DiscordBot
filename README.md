# Project details

Jinhsi Bot is a Discord bot designed to collect, unify and present relevant information about a video game from various online sources. The main goal of the project is to provide players with quick and centralised access to data without the need to visit multiple web pages.

The bot will serve as an automated assistant within a Discord server, allowing users to obtain up-to-date information about the game through specific commands. This will facilitate access to statistics, news, events, guides and other relevant data without leaving the Discord platform.

Jinhsi Bot still on developtment so there might be some parts that are not implemented yet.
